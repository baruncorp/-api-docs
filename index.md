- **Submit new projects and jobs** into our system

## üîÅ Workflow: Creating a Job

To create a job using the API, follow this typical workflow:

1. **Check if a project exists for the given address**
   - Use the [Projects endpoint](projects.md) to query by address or project attributes.
   - If a project exists, retrieve its `project_id` and `organization_id`.

2. **Create a new project (if needed)**
   - If no existing project matches, use the Projects endpoint to submit a new one.
   - Save the returned `project_id` from the response.

3. **Create the job**
   - Use the [Jobs endpoint](jobs.html) and include the `project_id` in your job submission payload.

This workflow ensures all jobs are correctly associated with their corresponding projects in the BMS system.
